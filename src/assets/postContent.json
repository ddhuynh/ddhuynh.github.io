In this project, my team and I worked on creating various appeal forms, as well as some custom Salesforce apps to view/approve/deny these forms.\n\n The biggest challenge of this project was the massive learning curve that came with Salesforce, but thankfully Salesforce Trailhead exists!\n\n There were also so many things to set up, from profiles to flows, but I learned a lot about Salesforce and teamwork from working on this project.",

I also created and designed the custom apps so that a group of users could see the pending forms.\n\n The thing I struggled the most with was understanding how to generate links to the apps.\n\n This is because the links to target certain apps are different than the URL link, so I had to figure out the syntax of the url string before I could generate one.\n\n The image you see here is of my badges in Trailhead, since I don't think I'm allowed to show the forms/apps we created (they look good though!)."

I decided to create my own portfolio website using vite/reactjs/github pages to challenge my web development skills. The image you see is an earlier look at the website.\n\n I've gone through so many different iterations of the site and made a lot of changes to the css file, it's crazy. However, I've gained a deeper understanding of frontend work, and I think this helped polish my skills.",

Amazing!\n\n It includes some CRUD operations, along with some really cool data visualization. Did I also mention that it comes along with an app that lets you log data on the fly???\n\n In all seriousness, this was a great project to work on. I learned a lot about the different parts of a tech stack, such as setting up a database, creating APIs to interact with the database, and using frontend api calls to display the info.",

Trust me.\n\n To me, the most challenging part of this project was figuring out how to test the APIs and set up things like emailing/registration.\n\n Creating/developing the mobile app was also another challenging aspect, since our team decided to use dart/flutter. However, once we got it setup, development for the mobile app went smoothly.\n\n I also struggled for a week with cookie management/using JSON web tokens before I figured out how to set it up."

I learned a lot about concurrency in C++ from the class, as well as how to communicate and work together with a team.",

        "description" : "Why is this on here? Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, I took a course that involved building a parser for a programming language, pl0. I still consider it one of the hardest classes I've ever taken.\n\n The main difficulty wasn't due to things like needing to code in C, or because I had to work on the parser by myself. It was mostly because I had to interpret the professor's code, which was an absolute amalgamation of too many files, too many places.\n\n To complete the project, I had to grasp the concept of using abstract syntax trees, which heavily relies on recursion. On top of that, you mix in the pointer madness of C, and you get SEGFAULT\n\n",

        "moreInfo" : "Even though this class was difficult, I still consider it a great class. It pushed me to my limits in comprehending/interpreting the code of others, as well as deepening my understanding of recursion/parsers/tokenizers.\n\n We also were required to use makefiles, so that was a bit of a learning curve.\n\n I also finished the parser without any AI help, for better or worse.\n\n The file you see here is almost 600 lines long, and it's one file out of many."
