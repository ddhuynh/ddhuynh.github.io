# My Personal Portfolio

This repository holds the source files for my static portfolio site.

A few notes:
1. Make sure your nvm, npm, and node versions are updated:
- https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm - Run the curl to install/update nvm.
- nvm install node - To install the latest node. (node alias default node -- To use latest node version. RESTART THE TERMINAL AFTER RUNNING THIS.) 
- nvm install-latest-npm - To install the latest npm.

2. Run ``` npm i ``` to install the packages, then run ``` npm run dev ``` to start the local testing stuff.
